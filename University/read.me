This is my master's thesis. 
Brief description:
The board is designed to work with a high-voltage transformer with an electrical voltage of 12kV on the secondary winding. Control is based on the principle of feedback, using a shunt resistor. By means of the shunt resistor the necessary value of current expected on the secondary winding of the transformer was set. The value of the set current was achieved by changing the voltage on the primary winding of the transformer. The primary winding control is based on the phase control method with the help of a triac.
